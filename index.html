I am a doctoral candidate in the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine with specializations in Education Policy and Human Development in Social Context.

My research focuses on educational policies and programs to improve the well-being of children. My work addresses issues of teacher professional development, class composition, school practices, and early childhood systems, particularly for children with multiple disadvantages (e.g., children living in poverty & with disabilities) My dissertation examines the heterogeneous effects of early interventions on children's disability and social-emotional outcomes
